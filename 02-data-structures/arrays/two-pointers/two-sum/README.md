## Problem: Two Sum

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

_Note: The standard Two Pointers approach works on a sorted array. This might complicate returning the original indices, but the goal here is to practice the two-pointers technique._

### Example 1:

**Input:**
`nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9`
**Output:**
`[0,1]`

---

### Constraints:

- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `-10^9 <= target <= 10^9`
- Only one valid answer exists.
